## Puzzland for Amiga

This repository contains the source code and disk image for **[Puzzland](https://amiga.abime.net/games/view/puzzland)**, a game I created on my Amiga during my early days as a programmer.

### About the Game

Puzzland is written in C (Lattice C) for the Amiga 500. In this game, pieces of a selected image scroll across the screen, and the player must place the highlighted piece in its correct position before it scrolls out of view. While it may not be fancy by current standards, it holds a special place in my heart as my first commercial product.

### Repository Contents

- **Sources/**: Contains the source code files for Puzzland.
- **Obrazki/**: Contains the image files used by the game.
- **DOC/**: Instructions in AmigaGuide format (in Polish).
- **ADF/**: The disk image of the compiled game, ready to be used with an Amiga emulator.

### Getting Started

To run Puzzland on an emulator, follow these steps:

1. **Download an Amiga Emulator**: There are several emulators available, such as WinUAE or FS-UAE. Choose one that suits your platform.
2. **Load the Disk Image**: Use the emulator to load the disk image found in the `ADF/` directory.
3. **Enjoy the Game**: Follow the emulator's instructions to boot up the game and start playing.

### Building from Source

To be honest, I donâ€™t have any idea how to build the game using modern systems (yet?)

### Reflecting on the Journey

Creating Puzzland was a significant milestone in my programming career. Reconnecting with this project has reminded me of the evolution of technology and my enduring passion for software development. While the code may be a relic of its time, it represents the foundation of my journey as a programmer.
